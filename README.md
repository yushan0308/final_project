# Ghana

This is my final project on Ghana

## Administrative subdivision of Ghana
There are 10 political regions and 139 cities in Ghana. Across the national boundary, southern regions including Western, Central and Greater Accra Region connect to the north Atlantic Ocean. Its capital Accra city lies in the Greater Accra region, which is in the south_eastern part of Ghana. 

The two regions I selected are Ashanti region and Eastern. Ashanti, in the north-west direction of Greater Accra, is the most populated region in Ghana. Surrounded by other 4 regions, Ashanti is also center of southern Ghana. Among 21 subdivided cities in Ashanti, Kumasi
is both the economic and geographic center. Eastern part is between the Greater Accra Region and Ashanti region. It has 17 cities
